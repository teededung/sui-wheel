      "overview": [
        {
          "question": "What is Sui Wheel and how does it work?",
          "answer": "Sui Wheel is a lucky wheel application on the Sui blockchain using smart contracts to ensure 100% fairness. Organizers create wheels, add participants (up to 200 people), set prizes and fund the reward pool. Results are determined by on-chain randomness, transparent and tamper-proof."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why choose Sui Wheel?",
          "answer": "Sui Wheel delivers 100% fairness with on-chain randomness, trustless security, fast speed with low fees, user-friendly interface and real-time tracking. Additionally, it supports advanced features like zkLogin, list import and flexible prize management."
        }
      ],
      "blockchain": [
        {
          "question": "What do I need to know about the SUI blockchain?",
          "answer": "Sui is a high-performance layer 1 blockchain designed for gaming and DeFi applications. Sui Wheel is built on Sui to ensure fast speed and low transaction fees. You need a Sui wallet (recommended Slush Wallet) to participate in on-chain wheels."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need to pay gas fees?",
          "answer": "Yes, on-chain transactions will consume a small amount of SUI for gas fees. However, Sui has very low fees compared to other blockchains. You only pay fees when participating in actual on-chain wheels, not for off-chain demos."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is Sui Wheel safe?",
          "answer": "Absolutely safe! Sui Wheel uses audited smart contracts and does not store user assets. All transactions are transparent and verifiable on the blockchain. Users always control their wallets and assets."
        }
      ],
      "features": [
        {
          "question": "How to create a wheel?",
          "answer": "<ol><li>Connect your Sui wallet</li><li>Add participant list (up to 200 people)</li><li>Set prizes and time</li><li>Fund the pool with sufficient tokens</li><li>Publish the wheel for everyone to participate</li></ol>"
        },
        {
          "question": "How can I add participants?",
          "answer": "<ul><li>Manually enter Sui wallet addresses</li><li>Import using online QR feature</li><li>Use X (Twitter) post import feature to automatically extract addresses from comments</li></ul>"
        },
        {
          "question": "What types of prizes are supported?",
          "answer": "Sui Wheel supports SUI tokens and other cryptocurrencies (coming next). You can customize the quantity and distribution of prizes flexibly according to your needs."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the difference between Off-chain and On-chain?",
          "answer": "Off-chain mode is for quick demos and testing without fees. On-chain mode is for real wheels with actual prizes, everything is transparent and permanently recorded on the blockchain."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does the Shuffle button work?",
          "answer": "Yes! The Shuffle button actually works and can be verified on-chain. When you press Shuffle, the system generates a new random order for the participant list, and this process is recorded on the blockchain to ensure transparency and fairness."
        }
      ],
      "frequentlyAsked": [
        {
          "question": "How to receive prizes?",
          "answer": "If you win, a claim link will be generated each time the wheel ends. Access this link to claim your prize."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is there a time limit for claiming prizes?",
          "answer": "Yes, organizers can set a deadline for claiming prizes. After this deadline, unclaimed prizes will be returned to the pool for redistribution or refunded to the organizer's wallet."
        },
        {
          "question": "Where can I track results?",
          "answer": "All results are recorded on the blockchain and can be viewed directly on Sui Explorer. Additionally, Sui Wheel provides a real-time tracking interface so you can monitor wheels and winners."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does it support Google login?",
          "answer": "Yes! Sui Wheel supports zkLogin with Google. This is the easiest way to get started with Sui Wheel. Remember that you need Sui coins in your wallet to create wheels."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can the wheel creator cancel the wheel?",
          "answer": "Yes, the wheel creator can cancel the wheel provided you haven't executed the wheel yet. The reward pool will automatically refund to your wallet when cancelled."
        },
        {
          "question": "What happens if I don't claim prizes before the deadline?",
          "answer": "You cannot claim prizes after the claiming deadline has passed."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can the creator recover the reward pool after the wheel ends?",
          "answer": "Only when the prize claiming time has ended; if not yet due, cannot recover."
